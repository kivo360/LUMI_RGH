<h1>What this is?</h1>
<p>This is a piece of software that was developed in conjuction with rochester general hospital and Rochester Institute of Technology. I was the main developer for this. The purpose of the software is to help administrators see information at a glance to make a decision. Therefore it would reduce the need for administrators to read extremely long reports to make bi-annual decisions. </br> There were complications with the cooperation from the RGH system that would make it so we couldn't continue the work. So I decided to make the software Open Source. Maybe other individuals could work on this to make it a better product.</p>
